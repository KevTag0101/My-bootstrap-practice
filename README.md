# Jovian Website Project  

This project was built while following the **Jovian Bootstrap Course**.  
It is a practice project to apply what I learned about **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.  

## Features  
- Responsive navigation bar  
- Sections styled with Bootstrap components  
- Simple and responsive layout for a learning platform  

## Notes  
- This project was created as part of a tutorial, not as an original design.  
- Some links on the page may not work (for example, navigation or external pages).  

## Purpose  
I uploaded this project to GitHub as a **capstone to showcase my progress** with Bootstrap.  
It marks the completion of my Bootstrap learning, and Iâ€™m now moving forward to learn **TailwindCSS**.
